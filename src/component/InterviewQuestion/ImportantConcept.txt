In React, when you pass a click event handler to a component, you can use 
either `handleClick()` or `handleClick` as the callback function. 

The difference between the two is that `handleClick()` is a function call, 
meaning that the function will be executed immediately, 

while `handleClick` is a reference to the function itself, meaning that 
it will be passed as a callback and executed when the event is triggered.

For example, if you use `handleClick()` as the event handler:

```
<button onClick={handleClick()}>Click me</button>
```

The function `handleClick` will be executed immediately when the button is rendered, 
not when it is clicked. This is likely not what you want.

On the other hand, if you use `handleClick` as the event handler:

```
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
```

The `handleClick` function will be passed as a callback to the `onClick` event and will only be executed when the button is clicked.

So in summary, if you want to pass a function as a callback to an event handler in React,
 use the function reference (without parentheses)
  instead of calling the function (with parentheses).
